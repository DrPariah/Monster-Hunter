# Monster Hunter: A modification file for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Monster hunter(`MH`) is a fantasy game about hunting down ferocious dinosaur-like monstrosities, with vast weapon and armor in its arsenal combined with oddly refined gameplay mechanics. I really though it could be a good twist for CDDA, so yeah... I just did and HAPPY HUNTING!

- The elder missions are WIP and the craftsman's crafting system is incomplete.
- Bug-hunters are appreciated :heart:

[`MH` wiki](https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Wiki)

## Monsters
To see the list of all monsters, go to *README.MD* inside the **Monsters** folder.

### Monster Ecology
Small monsters are scarce and timid in sight of players, and act much like real world animals - some runs away, some defend themselves, some hunts down other animals, including you.

Large monsters appear only by missions. If you feel like you're ready to take down a monster, just partake in a mission and slay them whenever you want!

***

## Items
This section consists of materials, armors and weapons appearing in the mod.

### Materials
These are your requirements in crafting or combining something and you'll be needing to collect them for future use. You can sell excess materials for a fair price...

#### Monster Materials
Carved(butchered) `MH` monsters has exclusive items in them and you'll need to have a high butchering tool to maximize your gatherings. Some items that are rarely obtained needs patience tho...

Be sure to know how to butcher an animal! Skinning the monster focuses on getting more monster materials that are used for common armorcrafts, while the full butchery extends the overall chances, in which you may gain supremely rare monster materials used in a more advanced crafts.

With increasing difficulty, monsters will provide an even better version of their materials. These materials will expand your equipment's power by the means of improvement.

#### Other Materials
These are other materials that are found scattered in your world. Examples are:

* needleberries - found in underbrushes.
* toadstools - found in forests and swamps.
* iron ores - found in some mining points.
* thunderbugs - a random swarm of bugs in the fields.
* small bone husks - bone piles in forests and commonly in caverns.

*All of these `Gathering Spots` have* "**?**" *in the top-left of their tile.*

With increasing difficulty, rarer materials will begin to show up... 

#### Consumables
Items that will help you survive while hunting monsters. There are two types of consumables:

* **Health** - herbs, potions, etc. These will heal you instantly, but costs additional turn to take effect. Consuming more of these in an instance makes you vulnerable to attacks.
* **Buff** - power seed, armorskin, cool drinks, etc. These are the temporary effects that are useful while performing hunts.

Raw consumables are obtainable in the `Gathering Spots`. With proper combos, effects are amplified and lasts even longer.

#### Combos
Item combinations require no tool, so crafting a bowgun shot is like putting a nut in a nut shell and only takes a turn to perform.

### Armors
Every `MH` armor provides huge defense from damage and are much way stronger and tougher compared to the real-world armors, but their storage is limited. Tho, creating them is a little bit complicated to do.
* These are full armor sets that consists of five armor pieces: helmet, mail, vambraces, tasset and greaves. Some special armors bear different armor piece name.
* Some are made of carved monster and other materials as their crafting requirements, some are made out only of cheap materials.

Also notice that all of these armors are designed for blademaster hunters, since the unique passive abilities from wearing a complete armor set isn't available in the mod...

### Weapons
Similar to armors, they are crafted from monster materials and their damage output were based directly from `MH` weapons. In CDDA, we have seven different weapon types:

* **Sword and Shield** - A lightweight sword paired with a shield that offers high blocking chance and a normalized attack speed. Low damage, but versatile to use.
* **Great Sword** - A towering heavy sword with high blocking chance but very slow attack speed. Its attack can deal immense cutting damage.
* **Hammer** -  A large, heavy weapon with slow attack speed but has a chance to stun the target. It doesn't block attacks, but deals pure bashing damage.
* **Lance** - A heavy spear with extremely high blocking chance but very slow attack speed. Though slow, its piercing attack can penetrate through targets.
* **Dual Blades** - A pair of sword/dagger with insanely fast attack speed. It doesn't block attacks, but deals pure cutting damage.
* **Light Bowgun** - A lightweight gun that offers descent mobility and range. Lacks damage and range, but has higher reloading speed.
* **Heavy Bowgun** - A heavy gun that deals tremendous damage in trade of mobility . Holds higher ammo capacity.

The other four weapon types - **long sword**, **gunlance**, **hunting horn** and **bow** - are not included due to their complexity.

***

## Scenarios
For those `MH` wannabes, scenarios are your key to become one.

* Awakened Hunter (MHFU) - In this scenario, you, as a lucky tyrant survivor, managed to escape your death. You've awaken, completely well-rested and greeted by the heart-warming welcome of the bright outdoor rays. Your journey, now rises along with your fame.

### Profession
Here's what you'll become from picking a scenario.

* Monster Hunter (MHFU) - You are replaced as a new hunter in your village after the past hunter retired. Your goal is simple: do what hunters do!

***

## NPCs
These are the village folks that interacts with the player. They will trade with you, offer you painful missions and many more!

### Traders
These are the people whom you need to buy and sell your things. Buying items require you **z**s to purchase while vice versa, selling earns you **z**s.

* **Buy** - Lists down the available items for you to select and purchase if you have enough **z**s for that.
* **Sell** - Lists down all of your `MH` items that are available to sell from your inventory.

New items can be bought once you complete certain missions.

### Craftsman
In the village, the craftsman is your key to progress in your `MH` gameplay. He will craft equipments instantly and you'll just need **z**s and materials for that. There are 3 options:

* **Create Weapon** - Crafts a new weapon. You will choose a weapon type to list down the available crafts. Upon selecting a weapon, its weapon data and required materials are shown.
* **Create Armor** - Crafts a new armor. You will choose an armor piece to list down the available crafts. Similar to weapons, essential details are shown when it is selected.
* **Improve Weapon** - Upgrades a weapon. You will need an upgradeable weapon in your inventory and select it to list down its available improvements, along with its weapon data and required materials. The resulting item is irreversible.

To avail new craftable weapons and armors, you'll need to complete certain missions.

**Improve Armor** not included, due to the *already* overpowered armor data. And also, the **Decoration** is way too complicated for this mod...

### Missions
Missions are categorized by star level (*), which tells you how difficult those missions are. Completing all missions in a category reveals a newer batch for you to initiate!

Completing a mission gives you two rewards:

* **Money** - Reward money in form of **z**s.
* **Materials** - Materials that are sent to your box at your house by random amount and chance. Materials are based on the completed mission.

### Money
**z**s are your money in the village. Your **z**s are required in many ways, such as paying the crafter to craft your equipments, buy supplies from traders and paying the mission's contract fee. To gain them, either sell `MH` items or by completing quests. 

**z**s has to be in your wallet! Without the wallet, you'll no longer be able to buy, partake in missions, or improve your equipments!

###### Everything is based on MHFU.
