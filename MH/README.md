# Monster Hunter: A modification file for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Monster hunter(`MH`) is a challenging game about hunting down ferocious dinosaur-like monstrosities, with vast weapon and armor in its arsenal combined with oddly refined gameplay mechanics. I really though it could be a good twist for CDDA, so yeah... I just did and have fun hunting!

- This mod is heavily WIP and most features are not included!

## Monsters
`MH` Monsters are the animals in `MH` ecology and much like in real world, they simulate the predator-prey relationship... In a very odd manner.

**Monsters in bold letters are implemented**. Few monsters are not included in the mod. Monster's unique abilities are not available in-game, like _Lunastra_'s fiery aura and _Kushala Daora_'s wind due to the limited json codes. Also, most of their special attacks are not doable in json, so we'll go with the plain ones :D

## Monster Ecology
Small monsters are scarce and timid in sight of players, and act much like real world animals - some runs away, some defends themselves, some hunts down other animals, including you.

Large monsters appear only by missions, just like in `MH`. If you feel like you're ready to take down a monster, just partake in a mission and slay them whenever you want!

## Items
This section consists of monster carved crafting materials, armors and weapons.

### Materials
Materials are essential in crafting `MH`-stuff, which are carved off directly from slained `MH` monsters as your rewards. Prioritize your survival skill before doing so.

### Other Materials
There are other materials that are found scattered in your world. Examples are needleberries - found in underbrushes -, machalite ores - found in some mining points -, and thunderbugs - a random swarm of bugs in the fields.

They are called *"Gathering Spots"*, with "?" in the top-left of their tile.

Not all armors and weapons are made of the same monster materials, some needs these miscellaneous items to craft, so be sure to collect them for future uses.

## Combos
Item combinations require no tools, so crafting a bowgun shot is like putting a nut in a nut shell (which is weird).

### Armors
Most armors provide huge defense from damage and are much stronger and tougher compared to the real-world armors, but they lack storage. Tho, creating them is a little bit harder to do.

* These are full armor sets that consists of five armor pieces: helmet, mail, vambraces, tasset and greaves. Some special armor bears different armor piece name, so be mindful about this before crafting an armor.
* They are made of carved monster and other materials as their crafting requirements. Some armors require a combination of two monster materials to craft.

Also notice that all of these armors are designed for blademaster hunters.

### Weapons
Similar to armors, they are crafted from monster materials and their damage output are based from the used materials. In CDDA, we have seven different weapon types:

* **Sword and Shield** - A lightweight sword paired with a shield that offers high blocking chance and normalized attack speed.
* **Great Sword** - A towering heavy sword with high blocking chance and very slow attack speed.
* **Hammer** -  A large, heavy weapon with slow attack speed and a chance to stun the monster. It doesn't block attacks.
* **Lance** - A heavy spear with extremely high blocking chance and slow attack speed.
* **Dual Blades** - A pair of sword/dagger with insanely fast attack speed. It doesn't block attacks.
* **Light Bowgun** - A lightweight gun that offers descent mobility and range.
* **Heavy Bowgun** - A heavy gun that deals tremendous damage in trade of mobility. Usually holds higher ammo capacity.

The other four weapon types - **long sword**, **gunlance**, **hunting horn** and **bow** - are not included due to their complexity.

###### Everything is based on MHFU. Further updates may go beyond that version (if ever...)
