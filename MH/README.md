# Monster Hunter: A modification file for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Monster hunter(`MH`) is a challenging game about hunting down ferocious monstrosities, with vast weapon and armor in its arsenal combined with oddly refined gameplay mechanics. I really though it could be a good twist for CDDA, so yeah... I just did.

- This mod is heavily WIP and most features are not included!

**Monster subspecies and monsters that has no craftable armors are not included in the mod.** Monster's unique abilities are not available in-game, like _Lunastra_'s fiery aura and _Kushala Daora_'s wind due to the limited json codes. Also, most of their special attacks are not doable in json, so we'll go with plain ones :D

## Items
This section consists of monster carved crafting materials, armors and weapons.

### Materials
Materials are essential in crafting `MH`-stuff, which are carved off directly from slained `MH` monsters as your rewards. Prioritize your survival skill before doing so.

If you want to see some carve-able monster materials, go to the *Materials* folder.

### Armors
* These are full armor sets that consists of five armor pieces: helmet, mail, vambraces, tasset and greaves. Some special armor bears different armor piece name.
* They are made of carved monster materials with their crafting requirements. Some armors require a combination of two monster material to craft.

Also notice that all of these armors are designed for blademaster hunters.

### Weapons
Similar to armors, they are crafted from monster materials and their damage output are based from the used materials. In CDDA, we have seven different weapon types:

* **Sword and Shield** - A lightweight sword paired with a shield that offers high blocking chance and normalized attack speed.
* **Great Sword** - A towering heavy sword with high blocking chance and very slow attack speed.
* **Hammer** -  A large, heavy weapon with slow attack speed and a chance to stun the monster. It doesn't block attacks.
* **Lance** - A heavy spear with extremely high blocking chance and slow attack speed.
* **Dual Blades** - A pair of sword/dagger with insanely fast attack speed. It doesn't block attacks.
* **Light Bowgun** - A lightweight gun that offers descent mobility and range.
* **Heavy Bowgun** - A heavy gun that deals tremendous damage in trade of mobility. Usually holds higher ammo capacity.

The other four weapon types - **long sword**, **gunlance**, **hunting horn** and **bow** - are not included due to their complexity.

###### Everything is based from MHFU. Further updates may go beyond that version (if ever...)
