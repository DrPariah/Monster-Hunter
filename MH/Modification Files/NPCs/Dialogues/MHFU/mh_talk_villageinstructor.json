To initiate a Quest, you must pay a contract fee! Fee... That means money! Got it?\n\nIII * Victory is fun! Losing... It means death.\nWhen clearing a Quest, you earn your reward. But failure means you absolutely lost your life!\n\nIV * First, try various Quests that have no contract fee.\nThere are Quests that require no contract fee. For instance, my esteemed Exercises!\n\nV * Achieve the goal condition!\nSlaying the target monster means you have completed the quest!\n\nVI * Practice is everything! Now let's get hunting!\nThe best way to learn the details of hunting is to try it all yourself. Let's go and take the first step in your hunting life! I've got high hopes!",
