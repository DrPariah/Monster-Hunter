## Monster Data
Here's the brief explanations of monster's structure in the wastelands.

### Aggressiveness
Some monsters are calm in the wild, though provoking makes them mad and destructive, but most lethal enemies like an `elder dragon` or some `wyvern` charges to their target upon sighting them.

Wyverns, pelagi, and other monster species are hostile to each other.

### Health
Large and alpha monsters have EXTREMELY HIGH health points. Killing one is a challenge and time consuming for most unprepared players.

### Attack
Large and some small alpha monsters have different `"melee_skill"` value and a damage type that varies in every monster. Some monsters deal abnormal status effects like poison and stun, some monsters deal elemental damage, some monsters may kill you quickly with just a few blows from their basic attacks.

Some extremely disastrous monsters like an akantor can take down trees, walls or strong vehicle armors with ease.

Remember! Your armor can't handle most attacks. Armor's role is to reduce the damage taken, not to negate them.

### Special Attacks
Fireballs, ice breath, etc. Most of these projectiles deal elemental damage and few can inflict abnormal status effects.

### Armor
Monster armor data is the same with their monster material resistances, except the **bash** and **cut**, which are already diminished by 10.

Small creatures like a vespoid have their armor datas reduced by half, while their alpha - the vespoid queen - isn't affected by this.

### Carves
Carved(butchered) items are exclusive crafting materials. If you've slain a `MH` monster, you may want to gather your rewards from it.

### Others
Monster data like `"speed"` and `"dodge"` differs in every monsters.
