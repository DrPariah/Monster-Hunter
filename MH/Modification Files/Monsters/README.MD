## Monster Data
As said earlier, they are boss monsters. Unlike normal CDDA monsters, these monsters has significance in various ways:

### Aggressiveness
They are calm in the wild, though provoking makes them mad and destructive. Most lethal enemies like an `elder dragon` or some `wyvern` charges to their target upon sighting them.

### Health
All monsters has EXTREMELY HIGH health points. A whole clip of M4A1 magazine isn't enough even to the weakest monster of this mod, or even a single mininuke explosion can't kill it.

### Attack
They have a constant 10 `"melee_skill"` and a damage type that varies in every monster. Some monsters deal additional effects like poison and stun, some monsters deal elemental damage, some monsters kill you instantly without wearing armors.

### Special Attacks
Fireballs, fireblasts, firewalls, etc. **THEY ARE CURRENTLY UNIMPLEMENTED!**

### Armor
Monster armor data is the same with their monster material resistances, except the **bash** and **cut**, which are diminished by 10. It is done to reduce the tanky-ness of most monsters.

### Carves
Aside from meat, some butchered items from a monster has exclusive materials that are required to craft various MH-related stuff like weapons and armors. **Before butchering them, make sure you have high survival skills to gain descent materials.**. Though not as defensive as power armors nor as devastating as the Barrett, they have advantage at some point...

### Other Data
Monster data like `"speed"` and `"dodge"` differs in every monsters. `Nargacuga` has high chance to dodge attacks and `Khezu` has very limited vision and mainly uses the sense of smell.
