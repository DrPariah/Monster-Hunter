## Monsters
In `MH` ecology, overpowered monsters are common to the sight of hunters, eager to be slain, but to the eyes of apocalyptic survivors... Well, what do you think?

Here's a brief explanation of monster's structure in the wastelands.

### Aggressiveness
Some monsters are calm in the wild, though provoking makes them mad and destructive, but most lethal enemies like an `elder dragon` or some `wyvern` charges to their target upon sighting them.

Wyverns, pelagi, and other monster species are enemies to each other.

### Health
Large and small alpha monsters have EXTREMELY HIGH health points. Killing one is a challenge for most unprepared players. 

### Attack
Large and some small alpha monsters have constant 10 `"melee_skill"` and a damage type that varies in every monster. Some monsters deal additional effects like poison and stun, some monsters deal elemental damage, some monsters may kill you quickly with just a few blows from their normal attack.

### Special Attacks
Fireballs, fireblasts, firewalls, etc. **THEY ARE CURRENTLY UNIMPLEMENTED!**

I'll be focusing on this after doing other essential stuff...

### Armor
Monster armor data is the same with their monster material resistances, except the **bash** and **cut**, which are diminished by 10.

Small creatures like a vespoid have their armor reduced by half, while their alpha - the vespoid queen - isn't affected by this.

### Carves
Aside from meat, some butchered items from a monster has exclusive materials that are required to craft various MH-related stuff like weapons and armors. **Before butchering them, make sure you have high survival skills to gain descent materials.**. Though not as defensive as power armors nor as devastating as the Barrett, they have advantage at some point...

### Others
Monster data like `"speed"` and `"dodge"` differs in every monsters. `Nargacuga` has high chance to dodge attacks and `Khezu` has very limited vision and mainly uses the sense of smell.
