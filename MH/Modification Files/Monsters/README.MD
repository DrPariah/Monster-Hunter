## Monster Data
As said earlier, they are boss monsters. Unlike normal CDDA monsters, these monsters has significance in various ways:

### Health
In MH, hunters have no idea about its health. This means that their health is practically that HIGH that you'll need 10-30 minutes of barraging attacks on them to kill. `Yian Kut-ku` is the weakest monster in the mod, with a 1125 health points.

### Attack
Damage system sucks at MH. Some monsters deal half your health with just a hit, and some attacks will not spare you at all. In CDDA, they have a constant 10 `"melee_skill"`, and a damage type that varies in every monster. Expect lethal enemies to shred your power armors!

### Special Attacks
Fireballs, fireblast, firewalls, etc. 

### Armor
Their armor is the same with the material data. Toughest monster wield the toughest armor available in crafting from their carves.

### Carves
Aside from meat, some butchered items from a monster has exclusive materials that are required to craft various MH-related stuff like weapons and armors. Though not as defensive as power armors nor as devastating as the Barrett, they have advantage at some point...

### Other Data
Monster data like `"speed"`, `"dodge"` and `"vision_day"` differs in every monsters. `Nargacuga` has high chance to dodge attacks and `Khezu` only uses the sense of smell and hearing.
