### Weapon Type Differences
Some things we need to take note about the balanced damage output:

* **Sword and shields** has a constant bash damage of 4 and a cut damage of base - 2.
* **Greatswords** has a constant bash damage of 8 and a cut damage of base + 8.
* **Hammers** has a bash damage of base + 10.
* **Lances** has a constant bash damage of 10 and a stab damage of base + 3.
* **Dual Blades** has a cut damage of base - 5.
* **Light Bowguns** has a constant bash damage of 6 and a ranged damage of base / 4.
* **Heavy Bowguns** has a constant bash damage of 10 and a ranged damage of base / 2.

Some weapons are not available in certain monster materials, like a kut-ku lance and khezu dual blades. Bowgun's clip size are based on the highest normal ammo capacity in MHFU, and is halved for LBGs.

### Bowgun Reload Speed
* **Very Slow** = 400
* **Slow** = 300
* **Normal** = 200
* **Fast** = 100
* **Very Fast** = 50

Compared to real-life guns, bowguns lack in damage and are dependent with their ammo types...
