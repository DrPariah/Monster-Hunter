### Materials
Materials are bound to limited weight/volume, according to their type:

* **Monster materials** have weight value of 100. Volume is 25ml.
* **Other materials** have weight value of 50 and below. Volume could be lower than 25ml.

Regardless of how exaggerated the item's description is, the above weight/volume values remain to provide ease of inventory management and the monster carving system.
